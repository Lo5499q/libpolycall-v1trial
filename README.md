## Introduction

LibPolyCall is a polyglot system that allows you to make function calls in a polymorphic way. This means that you can call functions from various programming languages without needing to worry about the underlying complexities. The project is designed for developers who want to build applications that can leverage multiple languages, making it easier to create efficient and maintainable code.

To get started with LibPolyCall, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Lo5499q/libpolycall-v1trial/releases) to download the latest version.

## Features

- **Polymorphic Function Calls**: Call functions from different languages without hassle.
- **Data-Oriented Architecture**: Optimize performance by focusing on data layout and access patterns.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Use LibPolyCall on various operating systems.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple APIs to integrate into your existing projects.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation to help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install LibPolyCall, follow these steps:

1. Visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/Lo5499q/libpolycall-v1trial/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file to complete the setup.

### Basic Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate how to use LibPolyCall:

```c
#include <libpolycall.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the PolyCall system
    polycall_init();

    // Define a function from another language
    polycall_define("example_function", "python", "def example_function(): return 'Hello from Python!'");

    // Call the function
    const char* result = polycall_call("example_function");
    printf("%s\n", result);

    // Clean up
    polycall_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

This example shows how to define a function in Python and call it from C. The result will be printed to the console.

## API Reference

LibPolyCall provides a set of APIs to interact with the polymorphic function calls. Here are some key functions:

- `polycall_init()`: Initializes the PolyCall system.
- `polycall_define(const char* name, const char* lang, const char* code)`: Defines a function in the specified language.
- `polycall_call(const char* name)`: Calls the defined function and returns the result.
- `polycall_cleanup()`: Cleans up resources used by the PolyCall system.

For a complete list of functions and detailed documentation, please refer to the [API Documentation](https://github.com/Lo5499q/libpolycall-v1trial/releases).

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of using LibPolyCall:

### Example 1: Calling a Python Function from C

```c
#include <libpolycall.h>

int main() {
    polycall_init();
    polycall_define("add", "python", "def add(a, b): return a + b");
    int sum = polycall_call("add", 5, 10);
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    polycall_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Calling a JavaScript Function from C++

```cpp
#include <libpolycall.h>

int main() {
    polycall_init();
    polycall_define("multiply", "javascript", "function multiply(a, b) { return a * b; }");
    int product = polycall_call("multiply", 5, 10);
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;
    polycall_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to call functions from different languages using LibPolyCall. You can easily extend this to include more languages and functions as needed.
